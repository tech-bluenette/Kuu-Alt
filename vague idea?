Start by generating the model representing the focus of our app:  Emails?

rails g model sender recipent message time_to_send:datetime

rake db:migrate

2.  user/index should show all messages
	user/show should show one message
	user/new/create should work together to let the user add a movie
	edit/update should work together to let the user edit an unsent message
	destroy should cancel an unsent message

rails g controller users index show new edit

refactor the routes
